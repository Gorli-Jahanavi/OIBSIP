🧠💻 Just Built My Own Voice Assistant Using Python! 🐍🎤

Super excited to share a mini project I built using Python — a basic Voice Assistant that listens to your commands and talks back! 🤖✨

🔧 Tech Stack & Tools:
➡ Python (main language)
➡ SpeechRecognition – to convert speech to text 🎙
➡ pyttsx3 – for text-to-speech conversion 🗣
➡ pywhatkit – for web search 🌐
➡ datetime – to tell current time & date ⏰📅
➡ Thonny IDE – lightweight and beginner-friendly 💡

🗣💬 What My Python Voice Assistant Can Do:
✅ Say hello when greeted
✅ Tell the current time and date
✅ Perform a web search for your query
✅ Handle errors (like silence or unknown input) smoothly
✅ All using simple Python code and logic!

💡 What I Learned:
🔸 Real-time voice input/output using Python
🔸 Handling exceptions and errors gracefully
🔸 Writing interactive scripts in Python
🔸 Working with multiple libraries in a modular way

📌 This was part of my learning journey with the OIBSIP internship, and I’ve pushed the code to GitHub for everyone to check out!


📈 Excited to add more features soon – maybe play songs, control apps, or even send WhatsApp messages 📱🎶

🔽 If you’re also learning Python, I highly recommend trying hands-on projects like this!
